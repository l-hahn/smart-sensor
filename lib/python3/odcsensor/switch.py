This module provides classes that relate/beling to the physical class of switches.
It can be used to easily read state from switches and transform physical states
into computer and human readable values.
Each switch instance will represent exactly one physical switch, so that
a certain switch pin related to exact one Switch.
The developer/user has to make sure, that there are no overlapping instances used...
In addition some basic functionality tests are provide as stand-alone script.
